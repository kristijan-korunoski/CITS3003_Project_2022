Abstract:
Introduction:
The current study examined how the morphology, photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the Amniataba caudavittata (yellow-tail grunter) species have been adapted to provide a survival advantage for feeding and behaviour within its environment.
Methods:
The A. caudavittata fish were caught and euthanised, allowing for the observation of morphological adaptations present. The left eye was then dissected (n=1) allowing for the analysis of photoreceptors in the retina under a light microscope. The left eye of a different A. caudavittata fish was obtained and a retinal wholemount was conducted, followed by staining allowing for the observation of RGC topography across the retina. 
Results:
An aphakic pupil and prominent countershading was observed in the A. caudavittata fish. Upon analysis of the retina, rods, cones and double cones were observed and the dimensions of each cell type were measured. The retina was sampled and an average RGC density of 2,870,275 cells on the A. caudavittata retina was observed. A retinal topographical map was produced to indicate RGC density across the fish retina, with the observed cell densities suggesting the presence of a dorso-temporal area centralis. 
Discussion:
The visual ecology of the A. caudavittata is adapted to optimise visual ability in underwater environments. Photoreceptor analysis indicated colour vision in the A. caudavittata species enhancing predator detection, aided by the morphological adaptations to camouflage against predators. The dorso-temporal area centralis is advantageous in the dense environment of the A. caudavittata optimising feeding behaviour by an enhanced frontal and inferior field of view.

Introduction:
Organisms heavily rely upon sensory systems to detect stimuli, allowing for the interaction with their environment and with other organisms. The perception of environmental surroundings is critical to ensure an organisms survival through their ability to find shelter, detect predators, forage, and breed. Structural and anatomical differences displayed in the visual system of different organisms are often reflective of an organisms environment, inhabiting different ecological niches. Retinal specialisations, such as a horizontal visual streak is formed by an elongated arrangement of high retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density, often representative of vertebrates that inhabit open environments, (Hughes, 1977; Collin, 1999). In contrast, the Terrain theory of Hughes (1977) depicts vertebrates living in areas of dense vegetation see a retinal topography indicating an area centralis (AC) with concentric layers of RGC density. The visual ecology of fish species demonstrates the morphological, photoreceptor and RGC adaptations in response to different environmental habitats and selection pressures, to provide survival advantage. 

	1.1 Fish morphology: 
Fish display many morphological adaptations in response to their environment, including shape and colour patterns. Sexual selection has driven the evolution of colour patterns, with vertical patterns providing a survival advantage in structurally complex habitats with dense vegetation, in comparison to horizontal stripes associated with piscivorous feeding and shoaling behaviour, (Seehausen, 1999). The visual system of fish also depict morphological adaptations such as eye stripes and eyespots which aid in preventing recognition by predators, and aphakic (lensless) eyes, which increases the binocular visual field by enhancing illumination levels on specific retinal areas, (Kjernsmo et al., 2016; Sivak, 1978). These adaptations of different fish species are uniquely tailored to their environment, providing advantage in recognising potential mates and predator/prey detection ultimately providing a survival advantage. 

	1.2 The yellow-tail grunter (Amniataba caudavittata):
The Amniataba caudavittata (yellow-tail grunter) species is native to Australia and New Guinea, particularly residing in coastal marine estuaries, along the Western Australian (WA) coast, (Webb & Gagnon, 2002; Potter et al., 2000). The species is a seasonal inhabitant of the Swan-Canning Estuary (WA), most abundant in the summer months following fish spawning periods, (Hoeksema & Potter, 2006). Migration downstream to deeper waters (<10m) occurs in winter months to avoid the abrupt decrease in salinity as a result of excessive influx of freshwater into estuaries from the river, (Wise et al., 1994). The A.caudavittata species typically inhabit shallow water environments ranging in salinity, surrounded by many different aquatic vegetation types including mangrove areas and seagrass beds, (Wise et al., 1994). This species is a benthic omnivore, predating upon algae, invertebrates, polychaetes and zooplankton, (Davis et al., 2010; Potter et al., 1994).

	1.3 Photoreceptors
There are three distinct photoreceptors present in the retina of a fish; rods, cones and double cones, (Ali et al., 1978). Rods are specialised photoreceptors sensitive to light, essential in mediating scotopic vision, which is important in levels of low light, such as in the deep sea, (Warrant & Locket, 2004). Teleost fish that live at depths below 200m have a specialised pure-rod retina, adapted to live in monochromatic light conditions, (Pankhurst, 1987). The presence of cones and double cones (DC) is depicted in temperate fish species living in shallow water, with DCs playing an integral role in motion, polarisation and luminance vision, (Hunt et al., 2015; Pignatelli et al., 2010). Differences in photoreceptor patterns demonstrates that visual ecology is unique and specialised amongst different fish species to enhance survival. 

	1.4 Retinal Ganglion Cells:
Areas of high RGC density indicate areas in the visual field with better visual acuity and spatial resolution. RGC density varies amongst species as a result of different environmental selection pressures. RGC specialisations occur in 2 topographical patterns, a visual streak, or an AC. In accordance to the ‘terrain theory’ of Hughes, fish that inhabit open environments have a more prominent visual streak and those in an enclosed environment  exhibit an AC (Collin & Pettigrew 1988; Hughes, 1977). RGC pattern has evolved to prioritise areas of high visual acuity in response to environmental stressors, enhancing an organisms survival within its ecosystem. 

	1.5 Aims & Hypothesis 
There is a paucity of information on the topographical distribution of the fish retina, despite the range of different aquatic environments. In this study, retinal wholemounts were used to quantitatively assess the topographical distribution of retinal ganglion cells to estimate the spatial resolving power of the A. caudavittata. The aim of this study was to assess how the morphology, photoreceptors and RGCs of the A. caudavittata have been adapted to provide a survival advantage for feeding and behaviour within their environment. 
It was hypothesis that the A. caudavittata will display rods, single and double cones. It was also hypothesised that a dorso-temporal AC will be present in RGC topographical analysis, with A. caudavittata species living in dense vegetation environments.

Materials and Methods
	2.1 Animal removal and euthanasia 
The A. caudavittata species were caught using a mesh net with a 10-12mm gauge in the Swan River (WA). Prior to analysis, the fish were terminally euthanised by administering a clove immersion oil (0.1%) and death was confirmed. The use of these specimens were approved by the government of WA, Department of Fisheries, and the University of Western Australia’s (UWA) ethics committee (Approval no. RA/03/200/576).

	2.2 Gross morphological observation
Anatomical observations of the A. caudavittata (n=3) were conducted noting, size, shape, colour and any prominent patterns observable on the body of the fish. Further specific observations of the eye were made including eye and pupil size and shape, lens shape, iris colour and pigmentation and eye position relative to the head. 

	2.3 Retinal Dissection
The left eye of the A. caudavittata (n=1) was dissected and placed immediately in a phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution. Once the eye was oriented, the cornea was separated from the sclera by cutting around the limbus, allowing the removal of the cornea and lens . Following this, the retina  was gently removed from the sclera and mounted onto a microscope slide with a drop of PBS. The retina was then teased and broken using fine forceps, and a coverslip was placed atop of the destroyed retina. 

	2.4 Photoreceptor analysis
An Olympus OM compound light microscope was utilised to analyse and characterise photoreceptors from the destroyed retina. Initially a graticule was photographed to obtain a scale bar at the same magnification as the photoreceptors. Images were taken on an iPhone 11, and photoreceptor images were analysed using an ImageJ software program. Photoreceptor images were analysed for the presence of rods, cones and double cones. A global scale was set using the graticule and the measure function on Image J was used to determine the dimensions of  5 cells of each type of photoreceptor.

	2.5 Retinal Wholemount 
The left eye of a different A. caudavittata fish (n=1) was obtained to analyse the topography of RGCs. The eye was removed from the specimen, and oriented by producing a dorsal cut. The cornea and lens were dissected allowing exposure of the retina, which was placed in a 4% buffered formalin solution for a minimum of 30minutes aiding in the removal of vitreous, and improving retinal integrity. The eye was then placed in PBS, and the retina was removed and flattened on a slide by making small incisions with a scalpel blade. The retina was then fixed with 2/3 drops of 4% buffered formalin for 5 minutes, before it was placed to dry on a heating block for another 5 minutes.

	2.5.1 Staining
Before the retina underwent the process of staining, it was placed in solutions of increasing ethanol concentrations to remove excess fat present. It was then placed in a series of decreasing ethanol concentrations before it was stained using 0.5% cresyl violet for 5 minutes. The retina was further dehydrated placed in increasing ethanol concentrations, until the retina was mounted and fixed with DEPEX and a coverslip. Further information on the cresyl violet staining protocol utilised in this study is provided by Ullmann et al., (2012). 

	2.6 RGC analysis
The total number and topographical distribution of RGCs in the ganglion cell layer of the retina was estimated through assessment of the retinal wholemount, (Coimbra et al., 2009). An image of the retinal wholemount was taken and imported into ImageJ software. The retinal area was calculated based upon a set scale and a grid was superimposed with a box area of 3mm². The RGCs of 27 boxes were randomly sampled across the retina. An iPhone 11 attached to an Olympus OM compound light microscope was utilised to take all images of the RGCs under the 40x objective lens. Initially a graticule was used to measure a scale of 0.05mm which was globalised to all images taken of the RGCs. A grid was superimposed across all 27 images of RGCs, with each grid box area = 0.001mm². One box was selected within each grid, and all cells within each box were counted. The results from each count were extrapolated to determine the RGC density of the area of retina sampled. RGC’s were identified as large more opaque circular cells with a dense nucleus, in accordance to the studies of Coimbra et al., (2012). It was difficult to distinguish between different cell types, therefore only small dense cells were excluded from the RGC count. The RGC density was calculated by multiplying the cell count by the field of view. The number of RGC counts were averaged, to calculate the estimated total number of RGCs within the retina. A topographical map was then produced to analyse results, similarly to that found by Garza-Gisholt et al. (2014).

3.  Results: 
	3.1 Fish morphology:
Anatomical observations were made of the A. caudavittata species (Figure 1). The body reflects a silver-grey colour covered in golden brown spots, containing prominent black blotches on the yellow tail fin. Countershading is also prevalent on the A. caudavittata body with darker pigmentation on the dorsal surface transitioning to a lighter pigment on the ventral surface. The fish is 200mm in length (Figure 1A) with the eyes positioned laterally on the head (Figure 1E). Observations of the eye depict an and ovular shape with an aphakic pupil, with pupil length and width as 7.26mm and 6.26mm respectively (Figure 1C and 1D). A golden-brown coloured iris is presented with prominent golden pigmentation surrounding the pupil (Figure 1B, 1C and 1D).

	3.2 Photoreceptor analysis
Photoreceptors morphology and dimension analysis was undertaken. Rods, cones and double cones were observed in the retina of the A. caudavittata species (Figure 2). The length (mm) and width (mm) of each type of photoreceptor was measured from an average of 5 cells (Table 1). The rods (length=0.0152±0.0033, width=0.0024±0.0005), cones (length=0.0236±0.0054, width=0.0088±0.0011), and double cones (length 0.0188±0.0026, width=0.0094±0.0011). Data is presented as mean±SD

	3.3 Retinal Ganglion Cell Analysis 
Analysis of RGC density in the A. caudavittata species was undertaken. The retinal area was calculated to be 255.59mm². The retina was sampled and an average cell density was calculated to be 11 231 RGCs/mm², which was extrapolated to produce an estimated total RGC density of
2,870,275 on the A. caudavittata retina. A retinal topographical map was produced to indicate RGC density across the fish retina (Figure 3). Retinal specialisations were observed utilising the retinal topographical map depicting a prominent increase in RGC density, suggesting a dorso-temporal area centralis (2.0 x 10⁴ RGCs/mm²).

4. Discussion
The current study aimed to assess how the morphology, photoreceptors and the RGCs of the A. caudavittata have been adapted to provide a survival advantage within its environment. It was first hypothesis that the retina of the A. caudavittata displayed rods, single and double cone photoreceptors, which was supported by the results obtained in this study. It was also hypothesised that a dorso-temporal area centralis will be present in RGC topographical analysis of the A. caudavittata retina. This was also supported by the results obtained. 

	4.1 Fish Morphology
Although the A. caudavittata species does not display any distinguishing bodily patterns, a countershading colour pattern was a prominent feature observed, with a gradation of colour from dark to light from the dorsal to ventral surface of the fish. Adopting this colouration pattern may contribute to the visual camouflage ability of the fish, being able to adhere to background colours and reduce visual cues to shape, (Penacchio et al., 2018).  The ability of marine organisms to blend with their background under specific lighting conditions suggests an adaptive survival advantage against predators through the use of countershading in these environments, (Ruxton et al., 2004). Countershading facilitates the ability to conceal shadows cast on the body of an animal. Penacchio et al., (2018) determined that when countershading was optimised to illumination conditions, the detection time of predator species were the longest, indicating the use of countershading as a survival advantage. This colour pattern is not only limited to predations detection, but may also play a role in UV protection and thermoregulation, (Rowland, 2008).

The presence of an aphakic pupil was observed in the morphological analysis of the A. caudavittata species, with a slight nasal pupil extension.  This extension acts to increase the size of the rostral binocular overlap of the two visual fields from each eye, and also enhances the ability of the eye to gather light, (Sivak et al., 1978). Fish that inhabit shallow water typically exhibit an anterior aphakic space which is typically associated with a temporally located area centralis, (Pankhurst et al., 1989; Sivak et al., 1978). An increase in the retinal illumination of the eye enhances an organisms field of view in specific retinal areas or the retina entirely, (Sivak et al., 1978). The increased retinal illumination and enhanced binocular overlap produced by the aphakic eye, increases the overall field of view of the A. caudavittata species, enhancing the ability to detect predators and prey within its habitat. 

	4.2  Photoreceptor Analysis
Rods, cones and double cones (DC) were present in the retina of the A. caudavittata species. The presence of rods and cones plays an integral role in vertebrate visual systems for the use in scotopic and photopic vision, mediating visual perception in different illuminations of light. Fish species living in the deep ocean inhabiting environments below 200m demonstrate a unique visual ecology displaying a pure-rod retina, due to the lack of light penetration at great depths, (Pankhurst, 1987; Warrant & Locket, 2004). As deep water fish have adapted to live in monochromatic light conditions indicated by the presence of a pure-rod retina, the presence of cones supports the yellow tail grunters known habitat, occupying shallow water environments, (Wise et al., 1994).

Studies have suggested the role of DCs in achromatic tasks such as the detection of light, motion and polarisation, (Cameron & Pugh, 1991; Hawryshyn et al. 2003). This is beneficial for the A. caudavittata species feeding behaviour and predation, resulting in the improved ability to detect targets with greater contrast to their surroundings as spectral sensitivity is increased, (Lythgoe & Partridge, 1989). Studies have also observed DC involvement in colour vision, determining that reef fish are able to discriminate between colours, (Pignatelli et al., 2010). Colour detection is integral in the diverse ecosystem of the A. caudavittata species, allowing for the recognition of other conspecifics and predators. The presence of DC may aid in the ability to detect predators, oncoming trawl and may enhance feeding behaviour of the A. caudavittata species. 
	4.3 Retinal Ganglion Cell Topography
A strong dorso-temporal area centralis was observed in the A. caudavittata species coinciding with the Terrain theory of Hughes (1977) as it inhabits environments of dense vegetation, supporting the hypothesis of this study. Within the temporal arm of the retinal wholemount, RGC are organised in concentric layers of increasing cell density, forming a temporal area centralis. Similarly to the A. caudavittata species, Teleost fish inhabiting coral reefs depict a prominent AC in the temporal retina, lacking a horizontal streak, (Collin & Pettigrew, 1988). This retinal specialisation suggests an uninterrupted field of view along the sand-water horizon associated with enclosed environments, (Collin & Pettigrew, 1988). Fish that demonstrate a larger body length above 80mm always possess an AC, with a correlation depicted between the preferred mode of feeding and the position of this AC, (Shand et al. 2000). Fish that predominantly feed on the bottom of the ocean floor possess a dorsal AC, in comparison to fish that occupy mid-water and surface habitats possessing a dorso-temporal AC (Shand et al. 2000). The A. caudavittata species typically inhabits mid-low aquatic habitats, surrounded by dense vegetation supporting the dorso-temporal AC observed, (Wise et al., 1994).

The dorsal arm of the area centralis in the A. caudavittata suggests a greater reliance on binocular vision accompanied by the aphakic pupil enhancing visual acuity in the central visual field which is  integral in depth perception and orientation in an ecosystem comprised of seagrass beds and dense aquatic vegetation. This retinal specialisation increases fixation rates on objects positioned in the central visual field, improving the discrimination of fine detail particularly utilised in foraging tasks, (Coimbra et al. 2012). Ben-Simon et al. (2012) described the importance of visual acuity as a result of a prominent area centralis in the interception of moving targets for predation of the Perciformes toxates fish species, which may likely assist predation behaviours of the A. caudavittata. Studies have demonstrated that a dorso-temporal extension assists in object detection in the inferior visual field, particularly in feeding behaviours (Hughes, 1977). A. caudavittata species are likely hunting species, predating upon algae, invertebrates, polychaete and zooplankton residing in the seagrass beds in the inferior visual field. The presence of a dorso-temporal area centralis in the A. caudavittata species suggests an enhanced inferior and central visual field, adapted to their environment by enhancing visual perception and feeding behaviour.



	4.3 Limitations
The interpretation of results within this study is limited by the quality of data obtained. Only a very small number of RGCs were counted and analysed across the retinal wholemount which may impact the accuracy and validity of the results obtained. Additionally, the difficulty in differentiating between cells of the retina may also limit the accuracy of the results by counting cells present that were not RGCs. As only one retinal wholemount was analysed for quantitative data, the use of additional specimens would have improved the quality of data obtained. 

	4.4 Summary
In temperate shallow water species, the dominant sensory modality allowing for environmental interactions is vision, (Pankhurst, 1989). The current study assessed how the morphology, photoreceptors and the RGCs of the A. caudavittata have been adapted to provide a survival advantage within its ecosystem. Morphological adaptations such as countershading and the presence of an aphakic pupil enhances survival by increasing the ability to conceal against shadows, increasing retinal illumination and enhancing binocular overlap. The photoreceptors permit vision under different light illuminations, and may aid in the perception of colour allowing for the detection of conspecifics and predators.  RGC specialisations such as the dorso-temporal AC allows for the optimisation of feeding behaviour of the A. caudavittata species. The visual ecology of the A. caudavittata is therefore adapted to optimise visual ability in underwater environments informing behaviour and feeding allowing it to flourish within its ecosystem.
